# Space Shooter

This is a space shooter game made in `pygame` for my VSB-TUO python course.\
It's a simple 2D game where you control a spaceship and shoot down enemy ships while avoiding their bullets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher, previous versions should work too, not sure which is the minimal one.
- Pygame

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements
3. Run the game with `python game.py`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Petrkowal/SpaceShooter.git
cd SpaceShooter

# Create virtualenv
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements (or just the pygame)
pip install -r requirements.txt

python game.py
```
